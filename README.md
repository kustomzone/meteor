Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web
applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

* in pure JavaScript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Try the getting started [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try).

Next, read the [guide](http://guide.meteor.com) or the reference documentation at http://docs.meteor.com/.

## Quick Start

On Windows, simply go to https://www.meteor.com/install and use the Windows installer.

On Linux/macOS, use this line:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Create a project:

```bash
meteor create try-meteor
```

Run it:

```bash
cd try-meteor
meteor
```

## Slow Start (for developers)

If you want to run on the bleeding edge, or [help contribute to Meteor](Contributing.md), you
can run Meteor directly from a Git checkout using these steps:

0. **Clone from GitHub**

    ```sh
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/meteor/meteor.git
    $ cd meteor
    ```

    > ##### Important note about Git submodules!
    >
    > This repository uses Git submodules.  If you clone without the `--recursive` flag,
    > re-fetch with `git pull` or experience "`Depending on unknown package`" errors,
    > run the following in the repository root to sync things up again:
    >
    >     $ git submodule update --init --recursive

0. **_(Optional)_ Compile dependencies**

    > This optional step requires a C and C++ compiler, autotools, and scons.
    > If this step is skipped, Meteor will simply download pre-built binaries.

    To build everything from scratch (`node`, `npm`, `mongodb`, etc.) run the following:

    ```sh
    $ ./scripts/generate-dev-bundle.sh # OPTIONAL!
    ```

0. **Run a Meteor command to install dependencies**

    > If you did not compile dependencies above, this will also download the binaries.


    ```sh
    $ ./meteor --help
    ```

0. **Ready to Go!**

    Your local Meteor checkout is now ready to use!  You can use this `./meteor`
    anywhere you would normally call the system `meteor`.  For example,:

    ```sh
    $ cd my-app/
    $ /path/to/meteor-checkout/meteor run
    ```

    > _Note:_ When running from a `git` checkout, you cannot pin apps to specific
    > Meteor releases or change the release using `--release`.

## Uninstalling Meteor

Aside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your
home directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.meteor/
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor
```

On Windows, just run the uninstaller from your Control Panel.
